## Introduction
Welcome to my game, I hope you're ready to embark on a cute and ~~chill~~ adventure in the French countryside.(**I HAD to** implement a win/loose logic so not that chill 💀)<br>
You'll incarnate Ducky the chick, so take care of him he's just a baby 🐤<br>

## To get Started
Ducky can only fly, so use your ⬆️ **Up Arrow** ⬆️ to make him grab some food and avoid enemies. <br>
Yeah, you will encounter ennemies. All kind of ennemies, but also collect all kind of food <sup>(could be pizza)</sup> !<br>

The more you collect food, the more you score points but also fuller will be Ducky's tummy 🍕<br>
But be careful, Ducky only has 2 lifes (which is already awesome for a chick🪄)

### I hope you will enjoy my game, thanks for reading ✨
